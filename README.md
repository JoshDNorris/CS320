Any software or program is expected to do two things well. It should function, or in other words do it's job. And it should be secure, protecting the user and the code from manipulation. Similarly to how testing methods should be kept in mind while writing code, so should security. Considering security from the beginning will help to build an overall safe program, instead of patching the code at the end. Functionality is where testing methods come in. Good testing techniques will ensure that the code does what it should at each level. 

User needs can be a tricky thing. Sometimes what the user wants is easy. Sometimes what the user wants is easy and clear. Other times it can feel like the person writing the code and the user are speaking different languages. This is why clarifying user needs, and ensuring code functions as needed is so important. This can mean going back to the user as the program is created to make sense of the needs.

My simplified approach to designing software involves three main steps. First, I like to thoroughly review the requirements. Then, code! Write a few lines, edit it, try it out. Make sure it runs as intended. Run it through the gambit of possible errors. Finally, run the program as a system. Make sure all pieces integrate correctly. Double check that it meets the original requirements given.
